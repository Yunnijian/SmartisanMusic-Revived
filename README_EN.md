Smartisan never saw itself as a company concerned with visuals alone. A beautiful interface was only the beginning; a product still had to solve real problems. Design, functionality, and interaction were meant to feel coherent—easy to understand on first use, yet rich enough to reveal small surprises over time. The “artisan” in Smartisan was not about placing a polished skin over a product, but about caring for every touch, response, and pause.

Smartisan Music is one of the clearest expressions of that idea. Its turntable, tonearm, scratching, and vinyl crackle make digital music feel tangible, while songs, albums, and the library remain calm and legible. The physical playfulness should never come at the expense of playback or organization; what deserves to be preserved is the balance between texture, order, and utility.

Smartisan OS has left the stage, so this project uses Smartisan Music 8.1.0 as its visual and interaction reference and rebuilds it with a modern Android stack. The interface is built entirely with Jetpack Compose and custom Smartisan components, preserving the original drawables, NinePatch assets, selectors, visual language, and layout proportions. Media scanning, background playback, queues, favorites, playlists, and persistence are rebuilt entirely on public Android APIs. Alongside the complete local playback experience, an optional NetEase Cloud Music account login adds online music: search, online playback, lyrics, and playlists once you sign in. Signing in is entirely voluntary, and the credentials are stored encrypted on the device only.

## Improvements over the original

- **Compose UI**: The app shell, library, search, favorites, playlists, settings, and playback screen use Compose. Screens are organized by feature, with shared Smartisan components for resource drawing, title bars, lists, and gestures.
- **Natural interface motion**: Album and artist grids reveal items in sequence, covers shrink into list rows, and dragged items make room with spring animations. Hierarchical navigation keeps the title bar stationary while staging its icons and sliding content horizontally. Full-screen pages such as settings slide vertically as a whole; panels and the sleep timer wheel use Compose animations, retaining the existing visual language and interactions.
- **Modern local playback architecture**: Media3 `MediaLibraryService`, ExoPlayer, and MediaSession power background and lock-screen playback, media notifications, headset and Bluetooth controls, and queue and position recovery after process restarts.
- **Rebuilt local library**: MediaStore indexes songs and provides song, album, artist, genre, and folder views, along with library exclusions, rescanning, sorting, filtering, and an alphabetical sidebar.
- **Rebuilt favorites and playlists**: The original favorites and user-created playlists are retained, with persistence and play statistics reimplemented in Room. The queue, current item, and playback position are saved and restored as well.
- **Expanded playback screen**: Embedded lyrics, a sleep timer, and a reorderable queue complement the original turntable and controls.
- **New personalization options**: Custom artist separators, reorderable and pinnable bottom navigation, switchable Home screen icons, and lightweight sound effects are added. The yellow vinyl icon from realme UI 7.0 Music is the default, with color and monochrome layers adapted to Android's adaptive-icon specification, while the original icon remains available. Sound effects include several presets and a custom equalizer curve.
- **Refined turntable interaction**: Tonearm dragging, vinyl rotation, scratching, crackle audio, and playback-state transitions are reimplemented for modern touch handling, lifecycles, and frame timing.
- **Richer library actions**: Multi-select, swipe actions, playlist insertion, audio-file sharing, and version-appropriate MediaStore deletion authorization are supported. Audio can also be opened directly from file managers and other apps.
- **Android 8.1 and later support**: Separate compatibility paths cover legacy and scoped storage, system bars, gesture navigation, display cutouts, WindowInsets, and standard back handling without replacing the original visual language.
- **Modern data architecture**: Room, DataStore, Coroutines, and StateFlow manage the library, favorites, playlists, settings, and playback state without private Smartisan OS services or system-signature capabilities.
- **Removed legacy baggage**: Business code is written in Kotlin and retains only the resources and public APIs required by the current implementation. The original background services, databases, and settings migrations are not carried forward.
- **Theme selection**: Supports system-following, light, and dark modes through a Compose page that reproduces the existing radio-style settings layout. Visuals remain resource-driven through `values-night` and same-name `drawable-night` variants. The original 8.1.0 had no dark mode, so the night visuals are this project's own design: the charcoal palette comes from the sibling Smartisan Weather revival (page `#25282D`, title bar `#292C31`, cards `#34373C`), and the night bitmaps are generated from the original assets by `tools/generate_night_drawables.py` (proportional darkening or white-out with alpha and nine-patch markers preserved; safe to re-run). The red and blue brand accents are shared by both themes.

## Current features

- Local audio permission flow, scanning, reindexing, and library folder exclusions
- Song, album, artist, genre, and folder browsing, with gallery-style album artwork previews
- Sorting, filtering, alphabetical navigation, blue list tap feedback, button press feedback, list multi-select with blue highlights, and swipe actions
- Favorites, user-created playlists, and play statistics
- System-following, light, and dark themes with a charcoal night palette
- Background playback, media notifications, and headset and Bluetooth controls
- Sequential, shuffle, repeat-one, and repeat-all playback modes
- Expandable queue, drag-to-reorder, and queue and position recovery
- Vinyl turntable, draggable tonearm, scratching, and crackle audio
- Static, line-synchronized, and word-timed lyrics embedded in audio files
- Original, Bass, Clear, Vocal, Rock, and custom sound profiles
- Sleep timer and system music volume control
- External audio opening, audio-file sharing, and MediaStore-backed media deletion
- Custom artist separators, bottom-navigation order and pinned items, and switchable app icons

Cloud Music (optional, requires a NetEase Cloud Music account):

- Account login with credentials encrypted and stored locally on the device
- Online search and playback; playback URLs are resolved automatically, refreshed periodically, and the audio stream is cached to disk
- Online lyrics (original, word-timed, and translations) and quality selection
- Home recommendations: banner carousel, daily picks, recommended playlists, charts, new releases, and popular artists; daily picks prefer the account feed and fall back when signed out
- Playlist, album, and artist detail pages with play-all and shuffle; radio listening
- Two-way synchronization of likes with the account's "favorites", with the local loved-songs list merging local and online tracks
- Playlist management: add tracks to a playlist, remove them, and create or delete playlists
- Publishes live lyrics to SuperLyric for desktop and overlay lyric modules

## Permissions and privacy

The app is a local player by default. The `INTERNET` permission is used only for online music requests once you voluntarily sign in to a NetEase Cloud Music account (search, playback, lyrics, playlists, and favorites sync). Login credentials are stored encrypted via `EncryptedSharedPreferences` on the device only, and the app never uploads your songs, artwork, lyrics, or library metadata.

- Android 13 and later use `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` to read device audio. Android 8.1 through Android 12 use the version-limited `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` is used only to keep user-initiated playback and its media notification active in the background.
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` supports playback effects and system music volume control, while `VIBRATE` provides interaction feedback.
- For song deletion, Android 11 and later use the system batch confirmation flow, while Android 10 grants access per file. Android 8.1 and Android 9 request `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` only after the user confirms deletion, then delete through MediaStore.
- The app does not request modify-system-settings, location, camera, microphone, contacts, SMS, overlay, or accessibility permissions.

## Build

Install JDK 21 and the Android SDK, then run:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug lintDebug
```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

To verify the minified release build, run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The release APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/release/` as `SmartisanMusic-Revived-<versionName>.apk`. The version is defined in [app/build.gradle.kts](app/build.gradle.kts).

Release builds use the production signing configuration: signing settings are read from `keystore.properties` at the repository root (both `keystore/` and `keystore.properties` are git-ignored). When that file is absent, the release build falls back to unsigned so local and CI debugging still work.

Build Compose UI tests with `./gradlew assembleDebugAndroidTest`; this does not run them on a device. See the [development and validation record](docs/compose-migration.md) for the complete validation commands and device regression checklist.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [People-11](https://github.com/People-11/) for [SmartisanOS_APP_Port](https://github.com/People-11/SmartisanOS_APP_Port/). This project used its `Music_8.1.0.apk` as a reverse-engineering reference for original resources, page hierarchy, visual details, animation timing, and interaction behavior.

People-11's work allows the original app to continue running on non-Smartisan devices. This project instead rebuilds media scanning, playback services, the library, queues, and persistence, using modern public Android APIs for system integration while preserving the original design language.
